## Logo Prompts

### Main Logo (512x512)
"Create a child-friendly, educational logo design. The image should be exactly 512x512 pixels with a clean background. Design should feature playful, rounded letters 'ABC' stacked or arranged creatively with '123' below or integrated, and a small open book icon. Use bright primary colors (blue, red, yellow) with soft edges. The style should be modern cartoon with a clean, professional look. Add subtle playful elements like small stars or simple shapes around the text. The design should work well at both large and small sizes."

### Medium Logo (192x192)
"Create the same child-friendly educational logo design at 192x192 pixels. Maintain the same elements (ABC, 123, book) but simplified slightly to remain clear at the smaller size. Keep the same color scheme and style, but reduce any small decorative elements to ensure clarity."

### Favicon Versions (32x32 and 16x16)
"Create a simplified version of the educational logo at 32x32 and 16x16 pixels. For this smallest version, use just the book icon or a single letter 'A' in the same style and colors as the main logo. Ensure the design remains recognizable even at this tiny size. Keep edges clean and use solid colors without gradients for best visibility."
